# intuition-contribution
I am trying to build a "Tip Jar" dApp for the Intuition Ecosystem.  This decentralized application will allow anyone to send small tips in the native Intuition token to a recipient's wallet address. The smart contract, which is the core of the dApp, will securely hold these tips until the recipient decides to withdraw them.
